BiwaScheme in Ace Editor
========================

I was wondering what would it look like to use some existing Lisp os Scheme interpreter implemented in Javascript together with some nice in-browser editor, to get Emacs Lisp *scratch* buffer kind of effect.

So I decided to use well known products: BiwaScheme and Ace Editor joined together in this little experiment.

So, open scheme.html and type (+ 10 20) and press Ctrl+Enter. The result will be inserted just after your command. Commands can be multilined (in which case empty lines are used as separators between various commands) or selected text.

Enjoy! :-)
